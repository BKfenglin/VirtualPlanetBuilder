2015-07-22 07:06  robert

	* src/vpb/SourceData.cpp: Fixed warning

2015-07-22 06:57  robert

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated Version number for 1.0.0 release

2015-07-22 06:55  robert

	* .: Branch VirtualPlanetBuilder-1.0

2015-07-01 17:12  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog and min OSG version number

2015-03-11 17:41  robert

	* From BjornBlissing, "Some users have reported that compiling
	  Virtual Planet Builder with Visual Studio have resulted in lots
	  of compiler errors. See:
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=13662
	  
	  This proposed fix replaces all calls to std::ofstream and
	  std::ifstream, to use osgDB::ofstream and osgDB::ifstream
	  instead.
	  
	  Which solves these compilation errors."

2015-03-05 20:14  robert

	* Updated version number for dev release

2015-03-05 20:14  robert

	* Updated ChangeLog

2015-03-02 20:09  robert

	* Added ddsNoAutoFlipWrite to osgDB::Options passed to
	  osgDB::writeImage() when handling .dds files.

2015-02-26 17:00  robert

	* Fixed setting of Terrain CoordinateSystem.

2015-02-17 19:41  robert

	* Fixed double creation of osg::State

2015-02-05 20:07  robert

	* From Stephan Wenglorz,"the attached fix corrects a link error
	  when using CMake 3 and building Debug on Linux (Debian). -lvpbd
	  could not be found when linking the applications against it."

2015-01-22 09:42  robert

	* From Stephan Wenglorz, "attached is a fix that aligns VPB with
	  the changes made in OSG trunk revision 14344. ReaderWriterOSG2
	  now expects the "file type" option to be set via
	  Options::setPluginStringData(), whereas VPB still used
	  Options::setOptionString(). This should fix the problem that
	  VPBReaderWriter aborts reading of .source files, so OSG tries to
	  load a non-existing osgdb_source plugin, as described here:
	  
	  http://forum.openscenegraph.org/viewtopic.php?t=14387
	  "

2014-12-22 11:28  robert

	* From Sebastian Messerschmidt, "Attached you find a patch against
	  the VPB-trunk.
	  
	  The only change is to make the vpb::LogFile write function
	  virtual in order to allow the use of user defined logging.
	  I would need this change, to integrate in the VPB chain into a
	  graphical user interface."

2013-10-28 11:13  robert

	* From Ruben Smelik, "I’ve tried VPB for the first time this week
	  (for the visualization of a high-resolution areal dataset), and
	  I’m very enthusiastic about it: it just works and is very fast!
	  During this, I’ve spotted a small error in Commandline.cpp, the
	  output bounds (“-b”) are not handled correctly if ymin > ymax
	  (e.g. as in UTM North coordinates). Attached is the fix (against
	  svn trunk version)."

2013-08-22 08:47  robert

	* Fixed warning

2013-05-30 09:05  robert

	* From Martin Naylor, "Fix for VS2010+ when compiling VPB."

2012-05-01 10:30  robert

	* Fixed build against 3.1.x

2012-02-17 15:45  robert

	* From Martin Lambers, "adds new options to choose the texture
	  type: --RGB32F and --RGBA32F.
	  Furthermore, it adds support for floating point data to the GDAL
	  import
	  code...
	  
	  To use these features with VirtualPlanetBuilder, build the
	  database
	  with the following options:
	  --RGB32F --image-ext gta -O "COMPRESSION XZ" -t <YOUR-DATA>
	  "

2012-01-02 16:02  robert

	* From Torben Dannhauer, "If one resumes a VPB run with reading in
	  a taskfile, vpbmaster immediately starts to read in the taskfile
	  without a single output line. Depending on the database size the
	  build_master.tasks file could be large and reading in takes
	  several minutes.
	  
	  I added an output message to taskmanager::read() before it reads
	  in the file to indicate vpbmaster is not hanging but working
	  already."

2011-06-23 15:56  robert

	* From Wang Rui, "This submission makes VPB work with MinGW 5.1.4
	  (gcc 3.4.5) under
	  Windows XP. It only adds some preprocessing directives so it
	  should
	  not break the build results with other compilers.
	  "

2011-06-21 17:35  robert

	* From Martin Innis, following disucssion about how tri stripping
	  now hampers performance on modern cards, removed usage of
	  TriStripVisitor.

2011-06-21 12:55  robert

	* From John Vidar Larring, "While testing OSG 3.0 I also recompiled
	  VPB trunk against it, and came across a few compile warnings from
	  gcc that was easy to fix / remove.
	  
	  The attached tgz file contains fixes for the following warnings:
	  
	  * trunk/include/vpb/BuildLog:190: warning: ?class vpb::Logger?
	  has virtual functions but non-virtual destructor
	  * trunk/include/vpb/Destination:72: warning: ?class
	  vpb::DestinationVisitor? has virtual functions but non-virtual
	  destructor
	  * trunk/src/vpb/PropertyFile.cpp:321: warning:
	  ?file.vpb::FileProxy::_requiresSync? may be used uninitialized in
	  this function
	  * trunk/src/vpb/TaskManager.cpp:105: warning: converting to ?int?
	  from ?double?
	  * trunk/src/vpb/TaskManager.cpp:174: warning: converting to ?int?
	  from ?double?
	  
	  When patch is applied VPB compiles without warnings."

2011-06-21 11:17  robert

	* Updated version number

2011-06-21 11:16  robert

	* Removed test problems and associated cmake scripts

2011-06-21 11:10  robert

	* Removed no longer required find scripts

2011-06-21 11:07  robert

	* From Jean-Sebastien Guay, "Trying to build VPB today I found out
	  that the FindOSG.cmake in VPB's own sources doesn't work if OSG
	  isn't in your path (and to avoid problems with some apps I've
	  started not putting OSG in my system-wide path anymore).
	  
	  CMake's own FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake works very well and has for
	  a while, so I modified VPB's CMake config to use that instead.
	  That change is attached. When merging please also delete the
	  CMakeModules/FindOSG.cmake and FindOpenThreads.cmake which are no
	  longer needed.
	  "

2011-01-13 15:00  robert

	* Moved the NVTT integration from VPB into the OSG using the new
	  osgDB::ImageProcessor interface.

2011-01-13 12:35  robert

	* Moved the interface further towards a generic OSG class
	  interface.

2011-01-13 11:48  robert

	* Restructed NVTT integration into a single class

2011-01-13 11:24  robert

	* Build fixes for building against NVTT

2011-01-13 11:14  robert

	* Began work on refactoring the NVTT usage so that it can be moved
	  into an OSG plugin

2010-12-20 17:10  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "A couple of small changes to VPB. I have
	  added the ability to specify the optional image and elevation
	  layout policy from the command line. I also implemented
	  serialization support for the compression quality and destination
	  extents so vpbmaster passes these options to osgdem."

2010-12-16 08:41  robert

	* From David Fries, "Don't fail silently when GDAL was not found.
	  Currently there isn't any indication there is a problem and the
	  cmake
	  output is identical to when GDAL is found, the only indication is
	  make
	  immediately returning without doing anything. Instead warn and
	  fail
	  if OSG or GDAL was not found, this also lets make invoke cmake
	  and
	  give the warning again.
	  
	  
	  
	  make
	  /usr/bin/cmake -H/opt/src/VPB/VirtualPlanetBuilder
	  -B/opt/src/VPB/release --check-build-system
	  CMakeFiles/Makefile.cmake 0
	  CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:324 (message):
	  GDAL was not found
	  
	  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
	  make: *** [cmake_check_build_system] Error 1
	  "

2010-11-25 11:57  robert

	* Changed VPB to default to outputting .osgb files

2010-11-25 11:37  robert

	* Removed assignment of GeometryTechnique to TerrainTile.

2010-11-25 11:35  robert

	* Fixed handling of .osgt and .osgx datasets to that images they
	  reference are now written out to disk.

2010-11-10 14:50  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I have gone ahead and implemented the
	  change to select the quality of the compression at runtime.
	  The results are quite dramatic:
	  
	  - Compressing a 1024x1024 image 3 times on my laptop I got these
	  results:
	  
	  DXT1
	  GL - 1.2 seconds
	  Fastest NVTT - 0.7 seconds
	  All other NVTT - 6.9 seconds
	  
	  DXT3
	  GL - 1.2 seconds
	  Fastest NVTT - 0.8 seconds
	  All other NVTT - 7.3 seconds
	  
	  
	  I am unsure what to use as the default option but as I could not
	  see any difference in the output with my single test image, I
	  have set it to fastest."

2010-11-05 16:20  robert

	* Re-enabled the old fchmod usage for Win32.

2010-11-05 16:15  robert

	* Merged support for GDAL1.7.0 from OSG.

2010-11-04 13:44  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "I have attached the changes that allow
	  the texture compression method to be selected via a command line
	  option. If VPB has been built without nvtt support and nvtt is
	  selected as the compression method a warning is logged but the
	  old technique will still be used.
	  I also made a couple of small changes to the Cmake setup.
	  - I added support for selecting a 3rd party directory (as in OSG
	  ) which is used to find gdal and nvtt.
	  - OSG wasn?t being found via osg-dir so I updated FindOSG
	  - When using the nvtt binaries from the Nvidia web site only
	  nvtt.lib is required so I made the other nvtt libs optional
	  (nvimage, nvmath etc)."

2010-11-02 13:49  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "The attached files fix a bug where RGB
	  instead of RGBA imagery was used for DXT3 and DXT5, and RGBA was
	  used for DXT1 instead of RGB. I have also added another command
	  line option --compressed-dxt1a which uses DXT1 with 1 bit alpha
	  for the output."

2010-11-02 13:47  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "As seen by Brad, the code with nvtt does
	  not works correctly when using --terrain.
	  So here is the fix in TextureUtils.cpp.
	  I also swapped the compression used with
	  BuildOptions::COMPRESSED_TEXTURE and
	  BuildOptions::COMPRESSED_RGBA_TEXTURE.
	  It dit not seems correct to use DXT1 for RGBA, i think it was
	  just a copy/paste error."

2010-11-02 13:02  robert

	* Build fix for gcc 4.4.4

2010-10-05 09:24  robert

	* Cleaned up header and indentation

2010-09-14 12:42  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "Here is a patch for VPB to work without
	  graphics context as discussed earlier.
	  It uses NVTT (NVidia Texture Tools) to support compressed texture
	  and mipmap.
	  The use of NVTT is optionnal, so no licensing issue. A define
	  directive is added (HAVE_NVTT) to select at compile time if NVTT
	  should be used, and in that case, it disables the use of graphics
	  context.
	  Tested on linux and windows."
	  
	  Tweaks from Robert Osfield:
	  
	  added CMake option BUILD_USE_NVTT_WHEN_AVAILABLE which defaults
	  to TRUE to enable toggling on/off the use of NVTT.
	  added nvimage, nvcore and nvmath to FindNVTT.cmake.

2010-09-09 09:34  robert

	* From Fabien Lavignotte, "Here is a small fix so that VPB can be
	  launched through VNC, when the display is different from :0.0.
	  readDisplay() is added to create the graphics context using the
	  current display."

2010-08-16 11:38  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen,
	  
	  "I have made changes in two areas that effect VPBMaster's
	  operation. The motivation for the changes come from writing a GUI
	  front end to VPBMaster.
	  
	  The first is changes to the logging behavior:
	  - If a master log file is set, this is now also used as the
	  operations log. This adds more detail to the master log file (it
	  is clearer what has happened, particularly in the case of
	  errors).
	  - Fixed a bug which meant the build log was not correctly passed
	  to the DataSet.
	  
	  
	  The second set of changes relate to the behavior of VPBMaster
	  when a run is finished. Prior to my changes the VPBMaster
	  executable would not terminate if the TaskManager had spawned any
	  threads, even once all tasks had completed. To change this
	  behavior so VPBMaster would exit on completion I made two
	  changes:
	  
	  - Implemented the exit(int) function in TaskManager (it was
	  defined in the header but had no implementation)
	  - Called this method prior to VPBMaster returning from main so
	  all thread are closed and VPBMaster exits cleanly."
	  
	  
	  Second submission:
	  
	  "The return value of TaskManager's run method was ignored by
	  vpbmaster, thus is the task manager failed to complete all its
	  tasks, vpbmaster would still return 0. My change to vpbmaster
	  checks the return value of TaskManager run and sets the return
	  value to 1 if the run method returns false."

2010-08-16 10:10  robert

	* Added checked for .osgb as this allows for mipmap/compressed
	  imagery.

2010-08-09 19:44  robert

	* Introduced nonZeroExtents() method and usage to avoid divide by
	  zero errors

2010-07-29 16:11  robert

	* From Wang Rui, ammened the ios usage when writing out source
	  files

2010-06-28 08:57  robert

	* Ammended the checking of image options.

2010-06-21 15:20  robert

	* From Wang Rui, fix to reading stream under Windows.

2010-06-17 11:10  robert

	* From Brad Christiansen, "The problem:
	  
	  When using VPB, if your destination has an alpha component, but
	  the source does not, no alpha is set on the destination. The end
	  result is the destination has an alpha value of 0 and is
	  completely transparent.
	  
	  
	  
	  The fix:
	  
	  Just a couple of lines that detects this situation and sets the
	  alpha on the destination to 255."

2010-06-10 15:23  robert

	* Added support for altering the imagery resolution per layer

2010-06-09 17:56  robert

	* Introduced the usage of the new osgDB serializers for IO support
	  for the source format, retaining backwards compatibility with
	  older .source files using old sytyle .osg support.
	  
	  Added support for per layer image options.

2010-06-08 11:53  robert

	* Implemented new serializers

2010-06-04 11:55  robert

	  added command line option:
	  
	  --blending-policy INHERIT
	  --blending-policy DO_NOT_SET_BLENDING
	  --blending-policy ENABLE_BLENDING
	  --blending-policy ENABLE_BLENDING_WHEN_ALPHA_PRESENT

	* Fixed build

2010-01-15 15:32  robert

	* Moved Serializer back from OpenSceneGraph into
	  VirtualPlanetBuilder to ease the way for the new
	  OpenSceneGraph/include/osgDB/Serializer
	  but avoiding build compatibility issues.

2009-07-01 16:17  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "Remove extraneous trailing whitespace at the
	  right end of lines with real code content
	  Unify the copyright header and update copyright range to 2009
	  Unify whether commandline options are listed with a period after
	  description or not
	  
	  The changes were done manually, not by script because a dumb
	  regex couldn't tell the
	  difference between intentional and accidental instances."

2009-06-22 15:37  robert

	* Update ChangeLog, README and NEWS for 0.9.11 developer release

2009-06-15 10:08  robert

	* Implemented checking for need patching database

2009-06-13 07:05  robert

2009-05-25 13:12  robert

	* Removed old method declarations that are no longer used.

2009-05-19 15:44  robert

	* From Chris Hanson, "VPB: Add -ge, -b and -gb versions of
	  extents-specification to command line:
	  
	  -ge <x> <y> <w> <h> Geographic (Lat/Lon) Extents of the model to
	  generate.
	  -b <xa> <ya> <xb> <yb> Bounds (similar to extents) of the model
	  to
	  generate. Max/Min order is not important.
	  -gb <xa> <ya> <xb> <yb>","Geographic Bounds (similar to extents)
	  of
	  the model to generate. Max/Min order is not important.
	  
	  These options allow you to specify an extents using geographic
	  (lat/lon coordinates). The "bounds" -b/-gb form allows you to
	  conveniently specify raw x/y,x/y coordinates instead of x/y,
	  x+w,y+h
	  coordinates, which is much more convenient when dealing with
	  geographic lat/lon coords. This helps in situations where you're
	  provided a box and you don't want to subtract to find the w/h
	  just so
	  VPB can add them back in for you. VPB will determine which is the
	  higher of each axis coordinate and fill the pair in on the
	  specified
	  axis, so you don't need to worry about whether your ya Latitude
	  is
	  lower or higher than your yb for example.

2009-03-25 11:59  robert

	* From Martin Innus, "Attached is a modified file to fix an issue i
	  was having with osgdem. As i wrote on osg-users, I was not able
	  to use the --terrain-tile-size option with a value larger than
	  256. The attached file fixes the problem for me. I just replaced
	  short with int in several places."

2009-03-24 21:13  robert

	* From Christophe Loustaunau: "If you want to generate a database
	  with two DEM files :
	  -one for the world.
	  -one for the USA with a better resolution and some NoDataValue.
	  
	  What would be logical when osgdem find a NoDatavalue for the USA
	  is to use the value of the world DEM.
	  If you use the option --no-interpolate-terrain, osgdem use the

	  taskManager->setRunPath(runPath);
	  
	  when vpbMaster read the --run-path option and it works. I don't
	  know if it's the better solution but anyway
	  here is the file modified vpbmaster.cpp"
	  
	  
	  Second submission: "If osg is compiled with

	  But when vpb want's to know if "c:" exist with osgDB::FileType
	  type = osgDB::fileType(path) It fails,

	  everything. :-)
	  - Additionally, I don't think extern is needed on the
	  declarations of the
	  functions in include/vpb/FileUtils. At least, everything compiles
	  and links
	  correctly on Windows when they are removed... It also compiled
	  well
	  when they
	  where there, so if it causes a problem on Linux then just leave
	  them.

	* Removed all osgTerrain classes, and merged changes:
	  
	  From Colin McDonald, "I was getting crashes in
	  DataSet::SourceData::readImage if one of
	  destHeight or destWidth came out to be one. There was also an
	  error
	  with alpha blending in that routine.
	  
	  Between osg versions 1.0 and 1.2 last year there was a large
	  increase in
	  the size of many database files produced by osgdem, of the order
	  of x2
	  to x4. Some other people have commented on it in osg-users, as
	  with
	  databases which were already large it has caused some problems in
	  transferring them to customers.
	  
	  I have done some investigation into the Simplifier changes during
	  that
	  period, and the principal cause appears to be a change in the
	  logic of
	  osgUtil::Simplifier::continueSimplificationImplementation.
	  Previously in
	  osg v1.0 it always carried on simplifying while the
	  simplification error
	  was less than getMaximumError(). But in osg v1.2 it stops
	  simplifying
	  whenever the max error is exceeded OR the target primitive ratio
	  is
	  reached. A simple adjustment to the targetMaxNumVertices in
	  DataSet::DestinationTile::createPolygonal reduces the database
	  sizes
	  near to the osg v1.0 sizes."

	  Robert Osfield.
	  Vivek's email to osg-submissions:
	  
	  "I'm happy to release the osgdragger nodekit to the OSG
	  community. I
	  implemented the nodekit for my company, Fugro-Jason Inc., and
	  they
	  have kindly agreed to open source it.
	  
	  The nodekit contains a few draggers but it should be easy to
	  build new
	  draggers on top of it. The design of the nodekit is based on a
	  SIGGRAPH 2002 course - "Design and Implementation of Direct
	  Manipulation in 3D". You can find the course notes at
	  http://www.pauliface.com/Sigg02/index.html. Reading pages 20 - 29
	  of
	  the course notes should give you a fair understanding of how the
	  nodekit works.
	  
	  The source code also contains an example of how to use the
	  draggers."

	  to add -O "plugin options",
	  some fix to osgdem.cpp and osgTerrain/DataSet.cpp
	  
	  These mods should allow to build terrains controlling jpeg
	  compressed
	  imagery embedded in ive files, using something like:
	  
	  osgdemd --image-ext jpeg --RGB_24 -O "JPEG_QUALITY 20
	  compressImageData" ......."

2006-11-22 20:52  robert

	* From Paul de Repentigny, "When calling osgdem with argument
	  "--image-ext", the application just

2006-11-14 12:55  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "I ran though the sample data that Gert
	  provided earlier today and tracked down the problem. The xoffset

	  on or before.
	  
	  Also fixed the GeospationExtents constructor that was setting the
	  _max to DBL_MIN rather

2006-07-31 20:56  robert

	* From Jason Beverage,
	  "I've attached fixes to DataSet that should fix the problems that
	  Maya was seeing yesterday. The issue was that the new
	  interpolation code I submitted didn't use the SourceData's
	  georef, it was assuming that the GDALDataSet had a proper
	  geo-ref. I've made the getInterpolatedValue method a member of
	  SourceData and now it uses the georef the SourceData's georef.
	  
	  I also forward declared the GDALRasterBand class in the DataSet
	  header."

2006-07-27 16:41  robert

	* From Jason Beverage, "This patch should fix Gert's problem that
	  he posted on osg-users. I downloaded the sample he posted,
	  reproduced the error, and added an additional check to make sure
	  the GDAL window size was valid. Now his example works fine.
	  Changes made against current CVS.
	  "

2006-07-11 10:34  robert

	* From Antoine Hue,
	  
	  "There was a typo in "int setNotifyOffset()", appear to be a
	  getter =>
	  "int getNotifyOffset()".
	  
	  Then I have added a switch to create GDALTermProgress only when
	  the
	  current notify level + local offset permit message display. In
	  fact, if
	  the offset is set to 0 and the notify level is at the default,
	  DataSet
	  is quiet but for the GDALTermProgress. That is quite disturbing
	  since
	  you think the progress is related to the complete processing but
	  it is
	  actually only related to the GDAL Warp."

2006-07-06 10:28  robert

	* Updated version numbers for 1.1 release

	  from GDAL.

2006-05-15 09:46  robert

	* From Carlos García and Paul Baker, Port of Paul Baker's Quake3
	  BSP loader to OSG by Carlos García.
	  
	  Added Quake3 BSP plugin.

2006-05-02 09:45  robert

	* Reorganised the Group::removeChild and Geode::removeDrawable
	  methods so
	  that removeChild(Node*), removeChild(uint) and equivilant Geode
	  methods are
	  now inline methods, not designed to be overriden, and seperated
	  out the
	  multiple remove method to be called removeChildren(uint, uint)
	  which is
	  now the only virtual method. There removeChildren is now the
	  method to
	  override in subclasses.
	  
	  This reorganisation requires some call code to be rename
	  removeChild usage
	  to removeChildren.

	* From Markus Trenkwalder, "when building debug libs in mingw the
	  .dll.a files are not copied to

	* Added support for equalizing the normals along tile boundaries.

2005-06-24 15:39  robert

	* From Colin McDonald:
	  
	  "Some makedefs fixes for Solaris:
	  
	  For multithreaded applications the -mt option must be specified
	  on both
	  the compile and link steps, to ensure correct behaviour.
	  According to
	  the Sun compiler documentation it sets REENTRANT flags in the
	  system
	  header files, and links the -lthread library in the correct
	  order.
	  
	  When compiling shared libraries the -KPIC option should be
	  specified.
	  Although Solaris will handle shared libraries without
	  position-independent code there is a performance penalty. The
	  linker
	  reference manual says: 'If a shared object is built from code
	  that is
	  not position-independent, the text segment will usually require a
	  large
	  number of relocations to be performed at runtime. Although the
	  runtime
	  linker is equipped to handle this, the system overhead this
	  creates can
	  cause serious performance degradation'."

2005-06-24 15:15  robert

2005-05-11 19:14  robert

	  Producer xplatform support for pbuffer instead of Win32 specific
	  pathways
	  as support before. (with a few code tweaks to simplfy the code,
	  by Robert Osfield).

2005-05-10 09:07  robert

2002-12-05 12:04  robert

	* Added first pass at a new logo, this time generated by a osglogo
	  demo.

2002-12-03 10:19  robert

	* Fixed the ifeq ($(OS),SunOS) so it was correctly on its own
	  seperate line, and
	  complimented by the required endif

2002-12-02 19:37  don

	* updated difference between forte compilers and gnu compilers on
	  Solaris

2002-11-27 05:29  don

	* Made LIB's dependent on PLUGINS for directories where both are
	  built

2002-11-24 21:36  don

	* Added Paging TerraPage loader and osgTXP library.

2002-11-20 07:46  robert

	* Fixed the texture apply method which was broken yesterday, the
	  new code wasn't
	  checking for the validity of _image before doing checks on it.
	  This breaks when
	  render to texture is used as there is no image to check
	  against...
	  
	  Added osgshadowtexture demo source. Demos still in development,
	  so don't expect
	  any shadows yet...

2002-11-19 12:26  robert

	* Updated OSX defs to compile osgSim and osglightpoint

2002-11-19 12:25  robert

2002-11-07 13:56  robert

	* Added Geoff Michel's new osggeomdemo program which allows control
	  of
	  geo models via the mouse.

2002-11-06 23:00  don

	* Oops... experiment gon awry in makerules. This works for Solaris,
	  but not
	  Linux, evidently. The goal was to do a dependency update on only
	  files
	  that had changed, since Solaris is so gawdawful slow at doing CC
	  -xM

2002-11-06 18:39  don

	* Changed a couple of const/non-const discrpancies between header
	  and source
	  for TexGen. Removed external library dependencies in plugin
	  makefiles

2002-10-31 12:51  robert

	* From Geoff Michel, added AC3D .ac and GEO .geo loaders.

2002-10-17 21:25  don

	* USE_MM was not defined for IRIX

2002-10-17 13:48  robert

	* Renamed the RenderBin::sort_local to sortImplementation(),
	  draw_local to drawImplementation() and added a new
	  RenderBin::DrawCallback().
	  
	  Added osgcubemap to the Make/ test scripts.

2002-10-10 12:44  robert

	* Added Macro's new cube map generation classes and osgcubemap
	  demo.

2002-10-08 07:39  don

	* Added AnimationPathManipulator to osgGA and modified sgv to use
	  it.

2002-10-08 05:41  don

	* Fixed some inconsistencies between header files and function
	  definitions
	  where the header file declared a parameter non-const, but the
	  function
	  definition expected a const. The Solaris linker was coming up
	  with
	  undefined symbols.

2002-10-07 21:23  robert

	* Added extra convinience methods to LOD - addChild(child,min,max).
	  
	  Added osganimate to test scripts.

2002-10-07 19:51  robert

	* Added new osganimate demo which demonstrate the
	  osg::AnimationPath in action.
	  
	  Added extra parameters to the AnimationPath callbacks to allow
	  finer control.

2002-10-02 15:28  robert

	* Added osgteapot demo to show how to implement custom Drawables to
	  wrap up OpenGL code.

2002-09-24 20:14  robert

	* Changed the linux linking of -lgif to -lungif.
	  
	  Fixed a typo in the Images name.

2002-09-24 20:04  robert

	* Changed the image file so that use the Images/ prefix to help
	  locate the files
	  within the OpenSceneGraph-Data directory.

2002-09-05 15:13  don

	* For Solaris, /usr/local/lib dependencies now compile static
	  libraries. This
	  reduces the dependencies for binary installs. ALso rearranged the
	  SunOS
	  gnu and Forte compiler sections to be more generic

2002-08-31 06:04  don

	* Added the script to make IRIX distribution packages (via 'inst').

2002-08-30 16:17  robert

	* Updates to windows build docs.
	  
	  Merge fixes for OSX from bob.
	  
	  Added checking for impostor sprites into stats.

2002-08-30 07:17  robert

	* Removed the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS define from the OSX build to
	  avoid
	  issues with the missing <sstream>

2002-08-28 16:17  robert

	* Added fixes to UnitTestFramework to get it compiling under
	  Windows.

2002-08-28 14:26  robert

	* Added Neil Salter's osgUtx library into the distribution, have
	  put all the
	  orignal seperate headers and source into
	  include/osg/UnitTestFrameWork
	  and src/osg/UnitTestFramework.cpp respectively. I have done this
	  to
	  keep the include and source directories focused on the scene
	  graph rather
	  than the test framework.
	  
	  Have added a very simple unit test to Vec3.cpp, which are
	  optionally
	  compiled in with the OSG_COMPILE_UNIT_TESTS define, which is only
	  currently defined in debug builds under unix. It should be fine
	  to
	  add it in under Windows project files as well.
	  
	  Finally, a new demo app osgunittests runs the tests and reports
	  success
	  or failure of the tests.

2002-08-27 14:02  robert

	* Added proper osgtexture1D demo - this demo uses a 1D texture to
	  dynamically
	  contour the scene.

2002-08-27 10:06  robert

	* Added osgtexture3D demo, renamed osgtexture demo to osgtexture2D,
	  and have
	  added osgtexture1D demo which currently is simply copy of
	  osgtexture2D. I
	  will be modifying it to do 1D texturing next.
	  
	  Fixed a bug in osg::Texture3D relating to checking of existance
	  of
	  texturing.
	  
	  Merged some fixes to the pfb loader from Ulrich Hertlein.

2002-08-22 17:36  don

	* Fixed a dependency order

2002-08-20 11:27  robert

	* Moved the IO support for the osgText and osgParticle libraries
	  into seperate
	  plugin libraries.

2002-08-13 18:29  don

	* Added some comments

2002-08-09 16:27  robert

	* Fixed the X and Y axis rotation billboards so that now rotate
	  correctly.
	  
	  Rewrote the osgbillboard demo so that it creates a point
	  rotatated billbaord
	  and X,Y and Z axis billboards to both test and demonstrate this
	  types of
	  billboards in action.

2002-08-03 18:11  robert

	* Integrated Ulrich Hertlien's osg::Sequence node, and osgsequence
	  demo, and
	  support for osg::Sequence in the pfb loader.

2002-07-26 15:37  robert

	* Added Ruben Lopez's Inventor/VRML 1.0 loader.

2002-07-25 14:42  robert

	* Removed double quotes from around the :
	  DBGF = -g -DOSG_USE_MEMORY_MANAGER
	  
	  As this was breaking the build.

2002-07-23 15:01  robert

	* Mods for HP-UX port.

2002-07-23 13:30  robert

	* Support added for Gnu C++ under Solaris.

2002-07-23 10:48  robert

	* Checked in Tino Schwarze's port to HP-UX.

2002-07-20 16:24  don

	* Added logo plugin

2002-07-19 12:51  robert

	  osglight demo.

2002-07-16 19:21  robert

	* Updates from Bob Kuehne and Kristopher Bixler to remove the fink
	  dependency from the MacOSX build.

2002-07-16 15:13  robert

	* Fixes for MacOSX build from Bob Kuehne.

2002-07-15 13:20  robert

	* Fixed the orientation of the osgreflect demo so that the
	  reflection plane
	  is orientated towards the viewer.
	  
	  Changed the lightmodel ambient level to 0.1,0.1,0.1 instead of
	  0.0, so that
	  a small amount of ambient lighting is available to render back
	  surfaces.
	  The osgreflect and osgprerender suffered unexpected behaviors
	  because of
	  no lighting on the backfaces.

2002-07-15 11:44  robert

	* Fixed memory leak in FieldReaderIterator.cpp.
	  
	  Updated the Make/osgtests.bat and Make/debugtests.bat scripts.

2002-07-15 10:53  robert

	* Renamed hangglide to osghangglide

2002-07-11 23:30  don

	* added -lpthread to the link line for Linux builds. Seems Red Hat
	  7.3
	  turns up undefined symbols without it.

2002-07-11 16:12  robert

	* Added support for multitexturing to osg::State and added
	  osgmultitexture
	  demo which adds as spherical environment map using texture 1 to
	  any model.

2002-07-10 13:33  robert

	* Updates to osgprerender to support use of rendering to an image,
	  rather then
	  just a texture.

2002-07-09 13:17  robert

	* Added new demo osgprerender to demonstrate how to prerender a
	  scene and use
	  the result in the main rendering for special effects.

2002-07-04 14:23  robert

	* Added osgGA to the MIGNW makedefs.

2002-07-02 15:01  don

	* -n32 and -64 entries were reversed in makedefs

2002-07-01 14:40  don

	* More 64 bit build specifics in IRIX makedefs file

2002-07-01 14:20  don

	* Removed -ldl from makedefs for IRIX

2002-06-21 16:45  robert

	* Added new osggeometry demo to test the work on the new
	  osg::Geometry Drawable.

2002-06-15 20:57  robert

	* Fixes for Visual .NET and Mingw builds, and fix MacOSX notify()
	  crash.

2002-06-13 16:21  robert

	* Further work on Occlusion Culling. Most of work is complete, just
	  debugging
	  required now.

2002-06-12 14:57  robert

	* Changes for MacOSX build, send in by Bob Kuehne.

2002-06-09 13:10  robert

	* Checked in migration from osgUtil based GUIAdapter code to Neil
	  Salter's
	  osgGA (Gui Abstraction). This may break users code, but all it
	  should
	  require to fix the builds should be a change from
	  osgUtil::CameraManipulator (etc) to osgGA::CameraManipulator and
	  include <osgUtil/CameraManipulator (etc) to
	  osgGA/CameraManipulator and
	  the extra dependency of the link line.

2002-06-08 19:58  robert

	* More more occlusion culling.

2002-06-05 12:44  robert

	* Checked in osgParticle, writtten by Marco Jez.

2002-05-28 23:43  robert

	* Added new osgcallback demo, and updated small API changes to
	  improve the
	  flexiblity of callbacks.
	  
	  Added beginings of convex planer occlusions culling.

2002-05-21 00:58  don

	* Modified instrules so that the functionality of instlinks is that
	  system links are not made to point to links, rather the real
	  files. So
	  links installed on a system are pointing to platform specific
	  files rather
	  than links that may be pointing to files of the wrong platform
	  type.

2002-05-10 19:30  robert

	* Added image plugin library defs for IRIX, submission from Randall
	  Hopper.

2002-05-09 10:31  robert

	* Added new osgGA - GUI Adapter library submitted by Neil Salter.
	  This will
	  replace the current GUI adapter code inside osgUtil.

2002-05-07 02:51  don

	* Fixed rpath nonsense in makedefs for Irix

2002-05-03 16:47  robert

	* Added support for the managing the StateSet above a LightSource
	  node,
	  and made it an osg::Group so that it can be used a decorator
	  above a
	  scene.
	  
	  Added osgclip demo to the test suite.

2002-05-02 00:14  robert

	* dded osg::ClipNode class for managing OpenGL clipping planes, and
	  osgclip demo.

2002-04-25 22:09  robert

	* Fixes for IRIX build.
	  
	  Fix for a warning under VisualStudio.NET.

2002-04-25 10:46  robert

	* A more verbose version of the test script, using each and more
	  memleaks.log
	  to print out progress and report any memory leaks which have been
	  logged.
	  The later will only occur with a debug build. The use of echo and
	  more
	  makes this version osgtest.bat not portable to windows
	  unfortuntately.

2002-04-24 20:04  robert

	* Changes for Mac OSX build, sent in by Bob Kuehne

2002-04-24 08:50  robert

	* Fix for the Cygwin build related to the new FileUtils_Unix not
	  using the
	  Windows PATH environmental variable for searching for libraries.
	  Sent in
	  by Norman Vine.
	  
	  Reoder of the makedefs/makedirdefs to fix Mac OSX compilation.
	  Sent in by
	  Bob Kuehne.

2002-04-22 09:50  robert

	* Added test script which runs all the demos in the OSG to make
	  sure they
	  run ok. User has to verify they are correct visually.

2002-04-18 15:37  don

	* changed LIBEXT to LIB_EXT for Darwin

2002-04-18 15:16  don

	* Added -lXi to the Linux X_LIBS

2002-04-16 21:39  don

	* Changed Linux makedepend flag from -MM to -M

2002-04-16 15:21  don

	* Added makedirdefs via a request from Bob Kheune. This allows us
	  to edit
	  the DIRS cruft in a single file in the Make directory instead of
	  having
	  to edit multiple files. Also edited Makefiles that needed to
	  include
	  this file.
	  
	  Also cleaned up txp loader to compile with SunOS. This needs to
	  be retested
	  on other platforms.

2002-04-16 05:29  don

	* Fixed some boo-boos in makerpms for building demo source files...

2002-04-16 04:13  don

	* Fixed Solaris 'make distribution' for demo source.

2002-04-16 03:24  don

	* fixed a few problems that didn't work right with installing demo
	  source
	  on platforms other than Solaris.

2002-04-15 21:48  robert

	* Compile fixes for IRIX, submitted by Randall Hopper.

2002-04-15 14:45  don

	* Added Daniel Sjölie's request to use a default complier (CXX) in
	  makedefs.
	  Doing this only for Linux

2002-04-12 06:18  don

	* Solaris PKG distribution now makes a shar (self-extracting shell
	  archived)
	  changed makepgk to do this.
	  
	  Changed another one of those pesky cout = std::cout in
	  CullVisitor.cpp

2002-04-12 05:09  don

	* added 'make cleandepend' to build system.

2002-04-12 05:06  don

	* Added the 'make cleandepend' target to the build system.

2002-04-10 21:51  robert

	* Added new osg::DrawPixels class with encapsulates glDrawPixels as
	  and
	  osg::Drawable. Added osg::Image::readPixels to osg::Image.
	  
	  Made osg::LightSource to default to cullActive set to false to
	  that LightSource
	  nodes don't get culled by default.

2002-04-10 01:29  don

	* Added (previously omitted) libpng, libjpeg, libtiff, libgif to
	  makedefs
	  in the Linux section

2002-04-09 22:54  don

	* Fixed makedepend to do the right thing.

2002-04-09 15:51  don

	* Checking in all Makefile.inst in src/Demos/*. These are the
	  Makefiles
	  that get installed rather than the build Makefiles.

2002-04-09 14:55  don

	* Added pkgadd distribution for Solaris.
	  
	  Added a cleaner way to install demo source so that installed
	  versions use a
	  simplified makedefs/makerules.
	  
	  Small fix to get osgText to compile with Solaris CC. Constructor
	  declared
	  with a non-const argument, but implemented with const argument.

2002-04-08 16:50  don

	* Added -lstdc++ to begining of LIBS on link line.. ??

2002-04-08 16:25  don

	* Put quotes around "DBGF" for multi argument

2002-04-07 17:47  don

	* Added a stop gap fix for cygwin build. Previous experiements were
	  creating
	  library and plugin files that looked like system library and
	  system files
	  which would have deleted original files on a 'make install'.
	  Cygwin is not
	  tested yet, but this needed to get fixed before a cygwin user
	  wiped out his
	  system library files.

2002-04-05 01:52  don

	* Edited INSTALL for new make and installation procedures.
	  Checking in a fix for Norman Vine
	  Added helprules and help.sh for a long-winded help message if you
	  'make help'.

2002-04-04 18:01  don

	* Added Norman Vine's changes for CYGWIN builds
	  
	  Added distrules and makerpms for building RPM distributions
	  
	  Removed old RedHatRPM distribution build directory
	  
	  Added new dist/RPM directory and placed temporary .spec files
	  (these
	  are generated by Make/makerpms and are not intended for
	  stand-alone
	  use, but they keep the directory warm and CVS happy)

2002-04-03 17:53  don

	* Cleaned up in stallation directives

2002-04-03 17:42  don

	* Reinstated Norman Vine's TARGET_BASENAME variable in the
	  makefiles and
	  added prefixes and suffixes to libs and plugins. ALl this to
	  accomodate
	  cygwin...
	  
	  Also added INST_SYS_PREFIX and INST_SHARE_PREFIX for
	  installation, as well
	  as "standardizing" the install locations for the various
	  platforms.

2002-04-02 06:58  don

	* Oops forgot to add makedefs and makerules

2002-04-02 06:44  don

	* The new order for building OSG. All Makefiles are replaced and
	  the Make directory is left with four files only :
	  makedefs
	  makerules
	  makedirrules
	  instrules
	  
	  These work for all platforms supported so far, which include :
	  Linux
	  Irix
	  Solaris
	  MacOSX
	  Cygwin
	  FreeBSD

2002-04-02 06:27  don

	* Folded in Bob Kuehne's changes for Mac OSX to makedefs and
	  makerules

2002-04-01 15:37  don

	* Added cleanlite rules to makerules.new

2002-04-01 04:54  don

	* *** empty log message ***

2002-04-01 03:39  don

	* Completed and tested instrules.new

2002-03-31 16:43  don

	* Added more to instrules and makedefs.new Folded in Randall
	  Hopper's
	  changes for FreeBSD

2002-03-31 16:40  robert

	* Added new osg::Projection node, and osgUtil::NewCullVisitor which
	  are work
	  in progress for the new support for controlling the projection
	  matrix from
	  within the scene graph.
	  
	  Also Added osg::State::getClippingVolume(), getProjectionMatrix()
	  and
	  getModelViewMatrix() with allows drawables to access the current
	  projection,
	  and model view matrices and the view frustum in local coords to
	  the drawable.

2002-03-29 06:54  don

	* Added new install rules for makefiles and updated makedefs and
	  makerules... more to come

2002-03-28 07:29  don

	* Couple a fixes in makedefs and makerules

2002-03-28 06:35  don

	* Added Norman Vines fixeds for cygwin

2002-03-27 16:31  robert

	* Futher updates to MemoryManager, fixed memory leak in osgconv.

2002-03-27 06:09  don

	* Update to makeefs/makerules

2002-03-27 00:55  don

	* update to makedefs.new makerules.new

2002-03-26 23:52  robert

	* Added support for osg::MemoryManager which is based upon Paul
	  Nettle's
	  memory manager published at flipcode.com. This can be turned on
	  with the OSG_USE_MEMORY_MANGER option which then uses custom
	  global
	  new and delete operators as well as provide osgNew and osgDelete
	  macro's
	  which add ability to log line and file from which calls are made.
	  
	  Updated osg,osgUtil,osgDB,osgText and osgPlugins/osg to use
	  osgNew/osgDelete,
	  and fixed memory leaks highlighted by the new memory manager.

2002-03-26 21:26  don

	* Adding makedirrrules to Make directory

2002-03-26 21:24  don

	* Temporarily adding makedefs.new and makerules.new to keep them
	  separate from current makedefs/makerules files. Will eventually
	  remove all makedefs.* and makerules.* and replace only makedefs
	  and makerules with makedefs.new and makedefs.new

2002-03-25 23:18  robert

	* Added osg::MemoryManger which is currently based on Paul Nettle's
	  memory manager
	  published at flipcode. I havn't adopted Paul's macro's for
	  new/delete etc, but use
	  osg prefixed versions instead to allow greater flexiblity in
	  handling include
	  ordering.
	  
	  Have fixed a couple of new/delete[] problems which existed as a
	  result.
	  
	  To use the MemoryManager to track memory usage simply add
	  -DOSG_USE_MEMEORY_TRACKING to the compile line.
	  
	  Have yet to move the osg from using new to osgNew, will do this
	  next.

2002-02-13 22:56  robert

	* Updated the makefiles to all have the #!gmake reference to force
	  IRIX
	  compilation using gmake rather than pmake or smake. This gets
	  round
	  issues with exporting OSGHOME.

2002-02-12 23:49  robert

	* Added a set of test runs to the makefiles and demos. The demos
	  now have
	  titles relevenat to their function.

2002-02-11 19:51  robert

	* Cleand up the root Makefile.
	  
	  Moved CullVisitor/RenderStage/RenderStageLighting across to
	  managing lights
	  entirely within RenderStageLighting, and changed the management
	  of modelview
	  matrices so that RenderLeaf now stores the absolute modelview
	  matrix, rather
	  than a model matrix as done previously. The later allows
	  RenderLeaf's to do
	  a glLoadMatrix rather than a
	  glPushMatrix/glMultMatrix/glPopMatrix.
